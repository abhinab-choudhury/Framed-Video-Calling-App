* **Agora:** The Agora SDK simplifies WebRTC development, offering features like high-quality audio/video, low latency, and scalability.
* **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows for creating dynamic and interactive video call components.
* **Express.js:** A Node.js web framework that serves as the backend server for managing user connections, rooms, and potentially additional functionalities like authentication.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* An Agora developer account and App ID (<https://www.agora.io/en/>)

### Features
