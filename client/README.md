# Framed - Video Calling Application (Client)

This directory contains the client-side (frontend) code for the Framed video calling application. It utilizes technologies like React.js to build a user-friendly interface for initiating and managing video calls.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or
  
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

This will typically start the development server at <http://localhost:5173> (the port may vary). You can then access the application in your web browser.


## Development

* Feel free to explore and modify the codebase to customize the user interface and functionalities of the client application.
* Refer to the main project README.md for overall project setup instructions and additional information.
